## skeleton ðŸ’€

**skeleton** is a tool that makes it easier to start new projects.

It stores your commonly used project specific files in one place, letting you
easily apply them to new projects.

In essence, a **template** is a file ending in `.skeleton` with a front-matter and
content. The front-matter is structured
[YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML?useskin=vector) with effect and free
variables.

An **effect** variable is pre-defined to perform some action. As of now, there are
only 3 pre-defined variables of this type:

| Name         | Type       | Required | Description                                                                           |
|--------------|------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `command`    | String     | No       | A command to run on a template post-write.                                            |
| `filename`   | String     | Yes      | Specifies the name of the templates destination location during application.          |
| `groups`     | Sequence   | No       | Groups this template belongs to, used commonly when batch applying templates.         |

See [subcommand.rs](https://github.com/terror/skeleton/blob/master/src/subcommand.rs)
for further elaboration on these effect variables.

A **free** variable is used to substitute into the templates content, you can also
specify whether or not to be interactively prompted for these types of variables
when applying templates.

The binary is called `sk` and has only been tested on a Unix-based machine.

### Prior Art

**skeleton** is a re-implementation and improvement of the Python program I wrote a while
back called **bp**, which you can find [here](https://github.com/terror/bp).
